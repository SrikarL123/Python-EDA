## **About Python**

Python is a **high-level, versatile programming language** that is widely used in data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation. It is known for its **simple syntax**, **readability**, and **extensive libraries**, which make it ideal for both beginners and professionals.

Key features of Python:

* **Easy to learn**: Clean and readable syntax.
* **Versatile**: Used in data science, AI, web apps, automation, and more.
* **Rich ecosystem**: Libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and **Plotly** simplify data manipulation and visualization.
* **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and cloud platforms.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the **process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics**, often using visual methods. EDA is the first critical step in any data science project to **understand the data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and generate insights**.

Common EDA tasks include:

* Inspecting data types, missing values, and duplicates.
* Statistical summary of numerical and categorical features.
* Data cleaning, transformation, and handling missing values.
* Data visualization using plots like histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and heatmaps.

## **Why Google Colab?**

Google Colab is an **online Jupyter notebook environment** that allows you to write and execute Python code in the cloud. It is widely used for EDA and data science projects because:

* No installation is required; runs directly in the browser.
* Free access to GPUs and TPUs for accelerated computation.
* Easy integration with Google Drive and GitHub for saving and sharing projects.
* Supports all popular Python libraries out of the box.
